						Hey everybody! Welcome to TechSupp0rt's Website. I have been meaning to make a website for my youtube channel for a long time now, but never really had any time to do it. Finally, a couple days ago I had some free time on my hands and I decided to make this website. I know its not very good because I had limited amounts of time to work on it. You will be seeing many updates happen to this website in the future. I will be posting youtube videos, downloads, and even some projects I am working on. This website will basically be a place where you guys can come to and find anything related to my youtube channel. Thanks for reading. Enjoy!
